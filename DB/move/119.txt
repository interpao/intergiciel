A move counts as targeting the user even if it hit multiple Pok√©mon, as long as the user was one of them; however, moves targeting the field itself do not count.  If the user has not been targeted by an appropriate move since entering the field, or if no Pok√©mon that targeted the user remains on the field, this move will fail.\n\nMoves that fail, miss, had no effect, or were block are still copied.\n\nAssist moves, time-delayed moves, ‚\u0080\u009cmeta‚\u0080\u009d moves that operate on other moves/Pok√©mon/abilities, and some other special moves cannot be copied and are ignored; if the last move to hit the user was such a move, the previous move will be used instead.  The full list of ignored moves is: acupressure, assist, chatter, copycat, counter, curse, doom-desire, feint, focus-punch, future-sight, helping-hand, magic-coat, me-first, metronome, mimic, mirror-coat, mirror-move, nature-power, perish-song, psych-up, role-play, sketch, sleep-talk, snatch, spit-up, struggle, and transform.\n\nThis move cannot be selected by assist, metronome, or sleep-talk, nor forced by encore.","type":"flying","priority":0,"target":"opponent","name":"Mirror-move","modified":"2013-12-24T15:24:30.359766","id":119,"power":0,"category":"status"}
