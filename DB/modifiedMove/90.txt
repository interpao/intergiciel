Ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers.  This move's accuracy is 30% plus 1% for each level the user is higher than the target.  If the user is a lower level than the target, this move will fail.\n\nBecause this move inflicts a specific and finite amount of damage, endure still prevents the target from fainting.\n\nThe effects of lock-on, mind-reader, and no-guard still apply, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target.  However, they will not give this move a chance to break through detect or protect.","modified":"2013-12-24T15:24:30.184116","id":90,"power":1,"category":"physical","type":"ground"}
